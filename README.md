## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project explores the use of various **AI tools and frameworks**â€”from classical machine learning to deep learning and natural language processing. The objective is to demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of modern AI tools such as:

- **Scikit-learn** â†’ Classical Machine Learning
- **TensorFlow / Keras** â†’ Deep Learning & CNNs
- **spaCy** â†’ Natural Language Processing
- **TextBlob** â†’ Rule-based Sentiment Analysis

The project also includes an ethics and optimization section to ensure responsible and efficient AI model development.
