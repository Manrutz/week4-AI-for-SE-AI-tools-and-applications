I recently bought a Dell XPS 13 and the battery life is amazing. Highly recommend!
The MacBook Pro keyboard keeps failing after only a month. Very disappointed.
HP Pavilion gives good value for money. Performance is decent but fan is noisy.
Acer Aspire is lightweight and great for travel, battery could be better though.
Lenovo ThinkPad has an excellent keyboard and robust build. Great business laptop.
